        <h3 style="color:  #0f5279;"><strong>Why Implement a Managed Release Cycle (MRC)</strong></h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">&emsp; The purpose of implementing a regular release cycle is to increase the
            stability
            of the production environment and provide better visibility into exactly what is going to change and when.
            An effective release management process allows IT to improve the speed and quality
            of changes to the production environment and to better organize the allocation of dedicated
            resources committed to oversee the integration of changes to our environment.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">&emsp;As part of this process change all deployments that are not urgent should
            be shifted toward the Managed Release Cycle.
            Project work that requires an exception to the process for some reason (e.g. vendor schedules, weekend only
            upgrades, etc.)
            should be brought to the attention of the Release Management Team&nbsp;(<a style="color: darkblue;"
                                                                                       href="mailto:ReleaseManagement@Acadian-asset.com">
                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ReleaseManagement@Acadian-asset.com</span></a>
            ) for scheduling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            &emsp;Included with initiative to move to a managed deployment cycle and the recent organizational changes
            to IT development teams, we have realigned the
            managers who can Manager Approve business side FootPrint tickets. Going forward the approvals will be done
            by Jim Soper, Sarath Akkineni,
            and John King as they are th;e managers closest to the business projects and development processes.

        <h3 style="color: #0f5279;"><strong>Exceptions to the MRC process:</strong></h3>
        <ul style="list-style: disc">
            <li>The following Footprints will <strong style="color: #0f5279">NOT</strong> Be subject ot the MRC process:

                <li>Any fix for an Urgent issue that is affecting our ability to do business</li>

                <li>New User creation, additional user permissions, or application access</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The <strong style="color: #0f5279">Data - Data Modification/Updates</strong> Footprint category
                should be used only for Footprints that are correcting a <strong style="color: #0f5279">data quality
                    issue</strong>
                . Missing, incorrect, or duplicate data that needs to be corrected ASAP due to potential business impact
                and can be corrected with a SQL script. Footprints
                that are changing application behavior but require nothing but a SQL script <strong
                        style="color: #0f5279; text-decoration: underline">should not</strong>

                to "<strong style="color: #0f5279;">Assigned</strong>" status.
                These tickets will need to go through the normal release cycle process again to become candidates for
                the next scheduled MRC deployment.
            </li>
            <li>Some Footprints approved for MRC deployment may be deployed after the standard MRC release day if there
                is a business constraint.
            </li>
            <li>Whether an exception to MRC or not, all Footprints should receive some measure of QA review. This can be
                accomplished through formal QA
                by that team or as a peer review but a second set of eyes should verify that everything is in order
                before the Footprint is Manager Approved

        <h3 style="color: #0f5279;"><strong>What is the Release Process?</strong></h3>
        <p>&emsp;We already have a Footprints process that we are accustomed to using and as we move to a Managed
            Release
            Cycle we are leveraging that existing procedures with some minor changes. With these changes the new
            workflow is as follows:
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
            <li>Users, BSA/ PMs and developers are encouraged to enter the Target Date field.
                <ul style="list-style: square;">
                    <li>In the case of an urgent hotfix or data update script that must be run ASAP this date will
                        be the same day.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the Footprint is not an urgent data update or urgent fix then the Target Date should be
                        set to the appropriate Tuesday.
                    </li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If there are any steps for DBOps to execute then DB Review Required has to be selected; no exceptions.
            </li>
            <li>DBOps will notify PSG if there are any steps for them and wait for their "OK" before DBA Approving.
                (This is required due to a lack of a "PSG Approval" step in the Footprints workflow)
            </li>
            <li>QA will wait until after DBA Approval before setting QA Approved.</li>
            <li>QA Approval must be complete by <strong style="color: #0f5279;"> 5:00 pm on Fridays </strong>for any
                ticket to be deployed on the following Tuesday.
            </li>
            <li>At 6:00 pm on Fridays, a report of the eligible tickets will be generated, e-mailed to all of IT. Once
                reviewed and annotated, it will be uploaded to the SharePoint site
                <a href="https://spteam.acadian-asset.com/IT/SitePages/ReleaseManagement.aspx">here</a>. **Only the PSG
                and DBOps Managers will edit the release management spreadsheet/report.
            </li>
            <li>Everyone with tickets that are expected to be released should review this list to ensure a ticket is not
                missed.
            </li>
            <li>Managers will Manager Approve as their schedule permits. When they review tickets, where necessary, they
                will add or update the Target Date field before clicking the approval button.
            </li>
            <li>Footprints are released by the Release Management team members according to their Target Dates and
                relative priorities.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 style="color: #0f5279;"><strong>What to do if a ticket is an emergency?</strong></h3>
        <p>&emsp;In the event that there is an immediate need to correct an issue in the production environment the
            Footprint should be marked with priority of <strong style="color: #0f5279">Urgent</strong>.
            The existing release process will take effect and Release Management staff will be paged to make them aware
            of the issue.
            Urgent Footprints are treated as a "drop what you're doing" situation so please keep this in mind when using
            this priority setting.</p>
        <h3 style="color: #0f5279;"><strong>What to do if deploying a ticket will prevent an emergency?</strong></h3>
        <p>&emsp; There will be times when a condition exists that we know is going to become an emergency; e.g.
            bad/missing data, incorrect results appearing on a report, etc.
            These <strong style="color: #0f5279;">hotfix</strong> situations should have the business reason the ticket
            needs to go out of cycle in the description.
